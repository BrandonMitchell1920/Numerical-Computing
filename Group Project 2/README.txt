The Python code requires the modules "numpy" and "matplotlib" to run.
These can be installed via "pip install numpy" and "pip install matplotlib".

The Python file "GroupProject2.py" will create the graphs when ran.  These
graphs are included.  It also writes the splines out to a file.

The original data points are included and the splines generated from them
are inlcuded.
